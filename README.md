## Development Setup

### Backend Setup (FastAPI)

1. **Navigate to the backend directory**:
```bash
cd backend
```

2. **Create and activate a Python virtual environment**:
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     python3 -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
   - On Windows:
     ```powershell
     python -m venv venv
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

3. **Install required dependencies**:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Run the FastAPI server** (development mode):
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8001
```

5. The API will be available at: [http://127.0.0.1:8001](http://127.0.0.1:8001)

### Frontend Setup (React + Vite)

1. **Navigate to the frontend directory**:
```bash
cd braille_app
```

2. **Install dependencies**:
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Start the development server**:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open your browser at the URL shown in the terminal (typically `http://localhost:3000`).

## How to Contribute

1. **Create a new branch** for your changes:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

2. **Make your changes** with clear and concise code.

3. **Run tests** to ensure nothing breaks.

4. **Commit your changes**:
```bash
git commit -m "Add meaningful description of your change"
```

5. **Push your branch**:
```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

6. **Open a Pull Request (PR)** on the main repository:
   * Describe what you changed and why.
   * Link any related issues, if applicable.
   * Ensure both backend and frontend work correctly together.

## Coding Standards

### Python (Backend)
- Use **4 spaces** for indentation (no tabs).
- Follow **PEP8** for Python code.
- Use **clear variable and function names**.
- Keep functions **small and focused**.
- Write **docstrings** for new functions or classes.
- Use type hints where appropriate.

### JavaScript/React (Frontend)
- Use **2 spaces** for indentation.
- Use **ES6+ features** and modern React patterns.
- Follow **functional component patterns** with hooks.
- Use **clear component and variable names**.
- Keep components **small and reusable**.

### General
- Write **meaningful commit messages**.
- Keep **dependencies minimal** and up-to-date.
- **Comment complex logic** clearly.

---

## Testing

- Ensure all existing tests pass before submitting a PR.
- Add **new tests** for new features or bug fixes.
- Test both **backend API endpoints** and **frontend components**.
- Run backend tests using:
```bash
pytest
```
- Test frontend functionality manually and with any existing test suite.

---

## Branching & Workflow

- **main**: Stable, production-ready code.
- **develop**: Latest development code (if applicable).
- **feature/**: Feature branches (e.g., `feature/add-gujarati-support`).
- **bugfix/**: Bug fix branches (e.g., `bugfix/pdf-generation-error`).
- **docs/**: Documentation updates (e.g., `docs/update-contributing-guide`).

**Always create a branch from** `main` (or `develop` if using GitFlow).

---

## Issue Reporting

Before opening an issue, **search existing issues** to avoid duplicates.

### For Bugs
Provide the following in your issue:
- Clear **title** describing the problem.
- Steps to **reproduce** the bug.
- **Expected vs. actual behavior**.
- Screenshots or error logs, if relevant.
- **Environment details** (OS, browser, Python version, etc.).

### For Feature Requests
- Clear **description** of the proposed feature.
- **Use case** and why it would be valuable.
- Any **implementation ideas** or suggestions.

### For Language Support Requests
- **Language name** and ISO code.
- **Liblouis table name** (if known).
- **Sample text** for testing.

---

## Adding New Language Support

Our project currently supports:
- Hindi (`hi-in-g1.utb`)
- Tamil (`ta-in-g1.utb`)
- Malayalam (`ml-in-g1.utb`)
- Marathi (`mr-in-g1.utb`)
- Bengali (`bn-in-g1.utb`)

### To Add a New Language:

1. **Check liblouis compatibility**: Ensure the language has a liblouis translation table.

2. **Update backend** (`backend/braille_utils.py`):
   - Add the new language to the supported languages dictionary.
   - Add the corresponding liblouis table filename.

3. **Update frontend** (`src/App.jsx`):
   - Add the new language option to the language selector.
   - Ensure proper language name display.

4. **Test thoroughly**:
   - Test with sample text in the new language.
   - Verify PDF generation works correctly.
   - Test file upload functionality.

5. **Update documentation**:
   - Add the new language to the README.md features list.
   - Update any relevant documentation.

### Language Table Resources:
- [Liblouis Tables Repository](https://github.com/liblouis/liblouis/tree/master/tables)
- [Language codes reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes)
